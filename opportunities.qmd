I am excited to build a collaborative, inclusive, and supportive group focused on advancing equitable and climate-adapted conservation science across diverse social-ecological systems. You can learn more about my lab group, the Future of Working Landscapes lab, [here](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/fowllab).

### Prospective graduate students
Graduate students can join the group through the Geography Department at CU Boulder (MA or PhD in Geography). I am also excited to work with students in the [Earth Data Analytics Professional Graduate Certificate](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/earth-data-analytics-professional-graduate-certificate). More information on the graduate programs in Geography at CU and the admissions process can be found [here](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/grad-program/graduate-curriculum). 

If you are interested in working with me, please fill out this [Google form](https://forms.gle/RwW6iiawoGLY6Q8x5). I will not respond to direct email inquiries, only to form responses (if you have technical issues with the form, please do email me at katherine.j.siegel@colorado.edu).

##### Funding
I encourage eligible applicants to apply for external funding, such as the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). CU also has a [database of external fellowships](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/funding/national-fellowship-opportunities) to check out.

##### Advice for navigating the graduate admissions process  
Choosing a graduate program and prospective advisor and then navigating the application and admissions process can be overwhelming, and there is a whole ["hidden curriculum"](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/grad-hidden-curriculum) of knowledge that prospective grad students are expected to know. Here are some resources that may help you during this process:  

- [Estien et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.2029) write about the hidden curriculum and provide advice on navigating the graduate school admissions process.  
- [A First-Gen's Guide to Grad School](https://first-gen-guide.com/resources/)  
- Dr. Alex Moore's [Moore Inclusive Lab](https://www.inclusiveconservationlab.com/resources) has resources on developing a research project, finding funding, the research and writing process, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice.  
- Dr. Jacqueline Gill has a great [blog post](https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/) with advice for contacting potential grad school advisors, including an example of an inquiry email to introduce yourself

### Prospective undergraduate students  
I am excited to work with motivated and curious undergraduates who are interested in assisting on my ongoing projects or developing independent projects. I will update this section with more information on how to get involved once I arrive at CU Boulder.  

### Prospective postdoctoral fellows
Prospective postdocs will need to apply for their own funding, as I do not currently have funding to hire a postdoc. Potential funding sources to look into include the [NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc), the NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in [Biology](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb) or [Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sbe-postdoctoral-research-fellowships-sprf), and the [Smith Conservation Research Fellowship Program](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows). Lily Dove and Clare Singer have also put together a [great document](https://t.co/RUgdbr3S13) on how to find and apply for postdoc positions. 

If working with me seems like a good fit for both of us, I am happy to provide feedback on proposal ideas and application materials. To start the conversation, please send me an email (katherine.j.siegel@colorado.edu) with a description of your current research, a brief description of your idea for a postdoc project and how it links to the lab's work, and your CV.
