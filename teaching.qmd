### Teaching Philosophy  
I prepare students and mentees for lifelong learning by teaching critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In addition to instructing students in course content, I empower them to develop skills to pursue self-directed learning beyond the classroom. I accomplish this by emphasizing active learning and demonstrating the applications of classroom concepts to contemporary issues.  

I strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment through guidelines for classroom interactions and integrating historically-excluded perspectives into class. During my PhD, I earned a Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education. This certification included classroom observation and feedback from a faculty mentor, syllabus design, and coursework in effective and inclusive pedagogy. I was nominated for the Extraordinary Teaching in Extraordinary Times Award in 2021 in recognition of my student-centered teaching during COVID-19 shutdowns.
